                  This Program was created by Prometheus Research and other contributors to the
                  RexDB Platform (<a href="http://rexdb.org/">http://rexdb.org</a>). As permitted 
                  by section 7b of the AGPL, we
                  require preservation of copyright notices and author attributions in this
                  Program's documentation and Appropriate Legal Notices.  This Program displays a
                  "RexDB by Prometheus Research" notice in its "about" command line option and in
                  its graphical "about" dialog.  In the graphical display of these notices,
                  author attributions may also include a graphical logo for this and other
                  software programs.
                </p>

                  For works containing this Program or any covered work, each interactive user
                  interface must include a prominent and conveniently accessible feature for the
                  display of Appropriate Legal Notices.  This display must include author
                  attributions and copyright notices as found in this Program.  This display of
                  these author attributions must be convenient for a user wishing to browse
                  credits, shown in a manner separate and distinct from license texts, and
                  commensurately prominent with respect to other author attributions.  To the
                  extent that it is technically feasible and not obtrusive, the graphical form of
                  these author attributions must be preserved in the Appropriate Legal Notices;
                  otherwise, a textual equivalent is permitted.
